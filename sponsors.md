# Projects & Sponsors



Developed the scope over the last months to narrow down to these projects similar difficulty and appropriate pre-requisites (ie: development language, loosely coupled to their internal systems). As such, the companies have already invested a notable amount of time in setting this up for you with no guarantee of a solid return.

All industry projects are real issues and an expectations of all that they will use at least a portion of your solution. Most projects have wider delivery scope while some have more fuzzy requirements... Like the real world.
