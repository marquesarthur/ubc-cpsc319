## Details

Deliverables as noted in previous slides. Very much like real world project deliverables and there is no answer key. 

* Subjective evaluation based on a combination of experience
    * TA
    * Me
    * Your teammates
    * Your industry project sponsors


VERY few templates provided (by design). If this does not make you comfortable, another course maybe better for you

### Individual performance factor

A factor applied to your team mark which ranges from 0.50 to 1.0. Input collected twice (prior to the mid year status meetings and prior to project completion). Anticipate majority of students will have a factor of 1.0.

* Two inputs which determined multiplier factor:
    * Your team mates assessment of your contribution.
    * Your TA assessment of your contribution.
