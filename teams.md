# Teams

Where possible work with teammates that complement your abilities, style and commitment (ie: expect 10-12hrs per week).
{: .info}

* Teams must be **7 people**.
* Two methods to joining a team:
    - Elect to sign up to a team by the end of class (preferred method).
    - I will assign a team for those individuals not in a team by Friday Jan 10th (pseudo random generator).
* Waiting list students, please do not join a team yet (except as a 7th person once team of 6 formed)

Once team of 6 or 7 formed, you will be assigned a project (randomly) during the first class. There will be three teams per project.

* A member of your team should send us:
    - Names and UBC student id of 6 or 7 members.
    - Please highlight any additional team members on the course waiting list.
    - Project assigned


Once teams form, this is set. This is not a reality show with firings and voting off team members.
