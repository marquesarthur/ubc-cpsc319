# CPSC 319 - Software Engineering Project

The design, implementation, and test of a large software system, using
a team approach. 

The course assumes you know how to write code (ie: from CPS310) and focuses more on how to bring your
solution from inception to production using a traditional waterfall SDLC methodology. 
Apply as much practical real-world scenarios in your team and workgroup.

using waterfall methodology. Yes, we will talk about Agile also.

requirements based testing into your projects

* Focus and value the importance of non-engineering components of
IT project delivery
